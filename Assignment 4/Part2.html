<p>
The biggest thing I have learned from reading these websites is that forms need to be flexible and easy to use.
Making a form relatively complicated will only stop someone from filling it out.
I want to make sure the order of the form makes sense and flows relatively easily with proper labelling to go along
with it. Another is to make sure that the form is completely compatabile with older browsers as well to ensure that anyone
and everyone has access to it. There are a ton of ways to make filling out a form easier for the user, such as auto-filling
and error warnings that pop up as soon as possible. Formatting should be straightforward, give an example of what you're looking for
but make the browser automatically format input without the user having to do it themselves. You also want to save the user the frustration
of not having to refill out an entire form after they submit and encounter an error. You want the form to remember the information so
it's easy for them to fix.
